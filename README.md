# CSharpTextAdventure
A basic text adventure in C#.

## Basic Commands
### Going places
You can either use the numpad (with NumLock on), the one or two character direction (n,ne,w,etc) or type out the full direction name (north, southwest, etc) to go in the cardinal directions. You can also go through portals in game by typing 'go [portal]' where portal is the specific thing you want to go through (like 'go door' or 'go hole').

### Looking around
Looking with either 'l' or 'look'. You can 'look item' to look at a specific thing in game.

### Checking your gear
You can see what items you are holding or have in your pack with the 'inventory' or 'inv' command.

### Getting things
You can get items from your inventory or the world around you with the 'get' command. You must have at least one free hand to get items.
